# Code First Girls Data and SQL Final Project

I took [Code First Girls' Data and SQL](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/classes/coding-kickstarter/) course during winter 2022/2023. This 8-week course covered:
- SQL programming language
- Database management
- Data analysis and manipulation
- Visualising data

This repository contains the final project that I presented at the end of the course. It is a database for an imaginary app to keep track and manage a nail polish collection. The file contains the code used to create the database and tables, the file contains sample data to populate the tables. The file contains the tasks required by the project guidelines, which include creating views, running subqueries, stored functions, stored procedures and triggers.
